# Data Structures
A set of generic data structures in java, with some algorithms.

Algorithms :
------
- List sorting : HeapSort, QuickSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort.
- Kruskal and Prim : minimal spanning tree.
- Dijkstra : Shortest Path.

Structures :
--------
- BST : Binary Search Tree, an optimal way of storing data for quick access.
- UnionFind : Useful for connectivity problems.
- Heap : create an N-heap. Mostly used for PQs.
- PQ : Priority Queue, min or max.
- Bag : store generic data, without removing.
- Graph and WeightedGraph : based on UnionFind.
