# Data Structures
Some data stuctures and algorithms, in java.

## List Sorting
- InsertionSort (for small arrays)
- QuickSort
- HeapSort
- MergeSort (not implemented yet)

## Graphs
- Data structure based on UnionFind
- Implementation of WeightedGraphs
- Minimal Spannig Tree (MST), with Kruskal algorithm
- Prim and Dijkstra alogritms (not implemented yet)

## N-Heaps
- Priority Queue : based on Heap Class, uses an ArrayList

## Trees
- Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Bag
- Simple data Structure
- Knapsack problem variant (can slice), greedy alorithm (not implemented yet)

## HashTable
- Hash function : h(k) = k mod M
- Uses open adressing to resolve collision
